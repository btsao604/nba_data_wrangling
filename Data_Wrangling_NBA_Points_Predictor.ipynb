    "My capstone project is based on the NBA statistics and specifically, to come up with a better predictor for points than the Y-T-D average or last year's average. The purpose of this would be to be implemented on a client-facing Fantasy Basketball website to show what your team's points will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the proposal, I will be gathering data directly from stats.nba.com - the official source of data for NBA statistics. More over, a group of programmers have put together the nba_py library - a Python facing API for stats.nba.com."

    "#### Summary\n",
    "After looking at the various documentations and other coder's codes, I have narrowed down my data sources to come from two modules in the nba_py source: PlayerStats and GameLog. On top of this, we will be depending on several Pandas features to merge the datasets together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NBA has been keeping a track of these statistics ever since the 1970's. However, we only care about recent years data so we can optimize our machine learning algorithmns to adjust for recent year's styles of play - especially since the recent rise of the 3 point shot/perimeter spreading. I will be take the last 4 years of data, with the first 3 years being my training set and my last year being my test set."

    "1. Player statistics can get skewed by \"garbage\" time players (players who only play during the last few minutes of the game when the game is not closely decided) and can get skewed by players with limited playing time.\n",
    "2. We can then limit the players to only players who play 30 games or more, and have played for more than 15 minutes to ensure we are doing our analysis solely on significant minutes players.\n",
    "3. The GameLog module does not keep a track of each player's position. Thus we will need to use the PlayerStats module to get the listsed position of each player.\n",

    "Now, it is important to note that this is our raw data. We can't use this data without first cleaning the data as the results can have forecast biasness in it if we are using the same Player's Game data to predict a player's Points. We'll need to clean the data and have a few assumptions in our data. The rest of this Jupyter Library will not have any markdown in it. I will be defining a function to combine these sets of data with our assumptions that I will list below to gather our 4 years of data. I will keep the function well documented while I work through my thoughts. After we create our dataframe for analysis, I will save them to CSV files for later analysis/machine learning applications.\n",

    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As mentioned, in the above PlayerStats module description, we don't want to take into account players who player a non-significant amount of time/not enough games. Thus we will be limiting the players players who play more than 15 minutes and have played more than 30 games.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will be using a rolling average for each player's individual statistics. The rolling window will be 3 games. This will mean that we will be dropping each players first three games to build the model. **This window may change depending on statistical significance. We may change this to every 5 games or a YTD. **\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As mentioned, we will be using the BasketBall Reference's definition of PACE. We will also be calculating the overall PACE and then doing a Y-T-D average on it. **This may change to take a Y-T-D average of every variable in the formula and then applying the formula.**"
